MVP (Minimal valuable product)

Functionality:

- Login
	All app functionality is bound to the context staff/point of service
- Remote patient search
	It's assumed that Impilo implements the Electronic Health Record in it's core modules
	A reference implementation might be found in https://openmrs.org/
- Select patient
	Patient management (add/change/delete/merge with other record) is part of the 
	Electronic Health Record management and must be done there.
- Initiate device action
- Receive device data
	It's assumed that the device data are in a format which are easily storable in the
	Impilo back end: plain text, JSON, XML, maybe images as the most complex format
- Send result to the back end
	Send data as structured visit/encounter data. The infrastructure might look like 
	https://rest.openmrs.org

Implementation considerations:

- Native Android App
    Sophisticated hardware interaction is assumed which can only be managed by a native app
	Minimal supported version to be decided (?)
- Programmaing Language
    Kotlin as it is supposed to be the new standard for Android
	
Enhancement strategy:

- Offline mode:
	Keep the functionality in case of lacking access to a network. This needs a client
	side patient data management and batch upload once network access is available
- Deep integration with other modules on the client/tablet
	As an initial standalone app besides other Impilo features it's tedious to follow 
	the login, patient search steps which might have benn done already elsewhere.

Project restrictions:

- 2 flavour approach: Integrate with Impilo and OpenMRS 
- Fine grain test case strategy for hardware device integration as this task has to be 
	split up between software developers and people which have hardware access
